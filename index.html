            <p class="intro">My name is <b>William Thaddeus</b>. I am currently a 5th semester Computer Science student at BINUS University with 3.81 GPA. 
                I have been so passionate about <u>software development</u>, <u>UI/UX design</u>, <u>project management</u>, and <u>socializing</u> with diverse communities since 
                entering college life. I am a hard working and curious person with good leadership skill, which I gained from joining organizations and
                being active in group projects. Eager to explore the technology world, I am open to any exciting work opportunities and collaborations.
